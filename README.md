# Git Workflow Playground

Read the [Beginner's Guide to Proper Git Workflow](https://medium.com/@anjulapaulus_84798/beginners-guide-to-proper-git-workflow-35a2d967734e) to learn the basics of Git commands and workflows.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) — A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) — You know what this is, right?
- [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) — Optional, but a handy tool for managing repositories without the command line.
